Various missteps in recent years have imperiled her lofty station. To resecure her standing in the ordning and prove that she is still the greatest smith among giants, Brimskarda has reclaimed the legendary Star Forge and set about crafting her greatest creation yet: a titanic war machine called a runic colossus.",
						"As proud as she is, Brimskarda knows that she lacks certain expertise necessary to complete her work. To fill the gaps in her knowledge and learn the secrets of the Star Forge, Brimskarda has kidnapped the renowned human smith Theldin and forced him to toil at the forge alongside her. Complicating matters is the Star Forge's most recent master, a red dragon named Akaanvaerd. Brimskarda's nephews have managed to draw Akaanvaerd away from his lair for now, but it's unclear how long they can keep the territorial dragon distracted.",
						"Work on the runic colossus is almost complete. Unless capable heroes arrive to rescue Theldin or defeat Brimskarda, it's only a matter of time until the region is turned to ash by an angry red dragon, a haughty fire giant, or a destructive war machine.",

The basic adventure seed\u2014\"a fire giant captures a renowned Humanoid smith\"\u2014comes from the {@book Fire Giant Skill table|BGG|_UNKNOWN} ({@book chapter 2|BGG|2}), with additional inspiration from the \"{@book Magnum Opus|BGG|_UNKNOWN}\" adventure idea connected to the {@book Star Forge|BGG|_UNKNOWN} ({@book chapter 4|BGG|4}). The name of the giant villain comes from the {@book Giant Names table|BGG|_UNKNOWN} (chapter 2), and the encounters within the Star Forge are inspired by the{@book Fire Giant Encounters table|BGG|_UNKNOWN} ({@book chapter 3|BGG|3}) and the {@book Elemental Fire Encounters table|BGG|_UNKNOWN} (chapter 3). The {@book map of the Star Forge|BGG|_UNKNOWN} is in chapter 4. The giant wrestlers of Fireside Monastery are {@book firbolgs|BGG|_UNKNOWN} ({@book chapter 6|BGG|6}), and several other monsters in the adventure come from the bestiary in chapter 6 ({@book cinder hulk|BGG|_UNKNOWN}; {@book fire giant forgecaller|BGG|_UNKNOWN}; {@book fire giant of Evil Fire|BGG|_UNKNOWN}).
